# SCQM_EHDEN
A public repo for the SCQM ETL created as part of EHDEN

Structure:

Code: Contains the actual ETL and the necessary supporting files
    
-ETL.R is the main file. It calls all the necessary smaller files in the code_files folder

-code_files: See above. Individual smaller chunks. Roughly split by subject, but sometimes also for reasons that no longer matter now that development is finished

-help_files: Sometimes the source data has a structure that allows for very clean mappings using .csv. All of those are in here

Data: Just some of the created outputs
